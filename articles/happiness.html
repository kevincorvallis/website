                                There is an old joke about a man who asks God every day to let him win the lottery. 
                                After many years of this prayer, he finally gets an answer from heaven: “Do me a favor,” says God. “Buy a ticket.” 
                                <br><br>
                                If you want happiness, reflecting on why you don’t have it and seeking information on how to attain it is a good start.
                                But if you don’t use that information, you’re not buying a ticket. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <i>"To attain happiness, we must not try to attain it." - Happiness Paradox</i> 
                                <br><br>
    
                                In truth, I think happiness requires effort, not just desire. 
								We fail on tests, relationships, getting the dream job, but our lazy mindset makes us default that it is the universe, not me. 
                                However, coursing back to the painful memories of each test question, conversation, interview, helps us understand. It is a painful process but the rewards are wonderful.
                                <br><br>
                                To ruminate, the self-aware mindset is very important. Dwelling on yourself that you had failed without recourse to new knowledge is a self time bomb; it reinforces your negative emotional status quo.
                                In contrast, self-awareness leads to new knowledge and realizations about yourself - attentive thinking process. 
                                <br><br>
                                Kobe Bryant said if he were to have a time machine the only problem is that he would never use it. Certainly we want to live a life without regrets but mistakes are inevitable. 
								However, reflecting and learning from those mistakes can give happiness because you are achieving a goal which is what Kobe is trying to relay. 
								We are happy and achieved status because of the mistakes we made and the lessons we have learned from them. How we learn from mistakes builds character. 
                                Afterall, we are most vulnerable to change when we are at our lowest points. 
                                <br><br>
                                I am known from my peers to be resilient and optimistic. As a computer programmer, I know the program is not going to run by itself. So I have no option but to take action and whether this might put me in a deeper hole, I am creating opportunity to learn.

                                <br><br>
                                Overall, you reflect, learn, and take action. Then, reap the rewards because you have grown. Sharing knowledge cements it in your mind so here I am.
								<br><br>
								When we share knowledge about how to become happier, we persuade ourselves every bit as much as we do others. It is psychologically proven that asking people to argue in favor of something can be a great way to get to believe in it. So share those secrets in life because it will also make you happier - doing so is an act of love. 

                                <br><br>
                                <b>Love is generative. The more you give, the more of it you get.</b>
                                <br><br>
                                Everything in life is worthwhile, so savor all those moments because if you put the work in, you will be more joyful and might make the world a better place.
