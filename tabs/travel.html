							<h3>Road trip - <i>2020</i></h3>
						<p>
							<span class="image right"><img src="../articles/images/idaho.png" alt="" />
							</span>This road trip was important to me. 
							I didn’t have any life changing experience or an eye opening epiphany that would alter me-
							 at least for now. Rather, I had time to think about myself, time to be alone, and just be
							  present. When I was on the road, I didn’t think about the past as much as I would have thought
							   nor my future. I just really enjoyed the discoveries I was making as I went explored the roads 
							   I have never been to.  - <i>Dec 08 2020</i> <br>

							<h3>Kevin vs. Ireland - <i>2019</i></h3>

							<h3>Oscar &amp; Kevin vs. Europe - <i>2018</i></h3>
						<p>
							<span class="image right"><img src="../articles/images/didsomedamage.png" alt="" />
							</span>It was nice just to forget everything and leave everything behind after the stressful week we had
						 about 10 days ago. Oscar and I both did good in school getting about 3.9 GPAs for this term. (Second time 
						 in a row getting all As). I’m proud of myself for the progress and I thank God for supporting me and being 
						 with me throughout the process. - <i>Dec 17 2018</i>

							<h3> Japan - <i>2017</i></h3>
							<p>
								<span class="image left"><img src="../articles/images/japan.jpg" alt="" />
								</span>The United States believed that
								ending the war with an atomic bombing
								before the Soviet Union declared war
								on Japan would curb Soviet influence
								after the war, and justify the tremendous cost of development to the
								American people. - <i>July 30, 2017</i>
